# Product_Company
An end-to-end product lifecycle management system inspired by Apple Inc., and developed as a full-stack web application.

A Product Company is defined and categorised as any company operating on a worldwide basis and developing their own products.
In such a company, there are many divisions, and in each division, many different processes take place.

Let us consider the example of Apple Inc.

Broadly speaking, Apple will have the following divisions:

    1) Design
    2) Manufacturing
    3) Warehouse/Storage
    4) Sales
    5) Service

amongst others. Our application covers the various aspects of all these divisions and brings them all together in a cohesive and effective manner.
